## 3. Strategic Analysis
*   **The "Loft" Evidence:** (DC Johnson & Witness 23) establishes physical evidence (shooting target) linking the firearms interest to Paul & Sam's former residence.
*   **The "Shower" Conversation:** (PC Gowlett) is a critical piece of evidence regarding communication between Sam and her father immediately after arrests.
*   **The "Salute":** Multiple witnesses (DC McDougall-Waters, PC Thomas) mention Paul Stephen "saluting" Gary/Josh, interpreted as a significant gesture.
*   **Digital Forensics:** DC Ladyman's evidence links Stephen Alderton to flight searches for the US, corroborating the "flight risk" or "relocation" narrative.

This list represents the *Local Authority's* filed police evidence for the Fact-Finding Hearing.
