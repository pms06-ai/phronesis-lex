2. BACKGROUND
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.1  [Describe family background]

2.2  Joshua Dunmore and I were never married. We had a child together, Ryan, 
     but separated. I am now married to Paul Stephen.

2.3  [Describe circumstances leading to proceedings]

3. THE EVENTS OF MARCH 2023
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.1  On 27th March 2023, there was an interim hearing in the Family Court 
     regarding child arrangements. The CAFCASS report recommended that 
     [Child] should not be removed from the UK whilst proceedings were 
     in place.

3.2  On 29th March 2023, my father, Stephen Alderton, shot and killed 
     Joshua Dunmore and Gary Dunmore. I want to make absolutely clear:
     
     (a) I had no knowledge that my father intended to harm anyone
     (b) I did not conspire with my father or anyone else
     (c) I was as shocked as anyone by these terrible events

3.3  On 30th March 2023, at approximately 00:35 hours, my husband and I 
     were arrested at [location] on suspicion of conspiracy to murder.

3.4  On 31st March 2023, we were released with No Further Action.

3.5  On 12th May 2023, DCI Katie Dounias wrote to advise that our suspect 
     status had been reinstated.

3.6  On 7th June 2023, we were re-arrested and interviewed. We gave "no 
     comment" interviews on legal advice.

3.7  On 12th February 2025, after almost two years of investigation, we 
     received notification of No Further Action. The police concluded there 
     was "insufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction."

4. MY CONCERNS ABOUT THE PROCEEDINGS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.1  POLICE INVESTIGATION
     I am concerned that the police investigation was not conducted fairly:
     
     (a) [Specific concern 1]
     (b) [Specific concern 2]

4.2  LOCAL AUTHORITY CONDUCT
     I am concerned that the Local Authority:
     
     (a) Failed to disclose relevant material
     (b) Presented a one-sided case to the court
     (c) Did not adequately evidence the threshold criteria
     (d) [Other concerns]

4.3  CAFCASS
     I am concerned that CAFCASS:
     
     (a) Did not act independently of the Local Authority
     (b) [Other concerns]

4.4  COURT PROCEEDINGS
     I am concerned about procedural fairness:
     
     (a) [Specific concerns about hearings]

understand that proceedings for contempt of court may be brought against 
anyone who makes, or causes to be made, a false statement in a document 
verified by a statement of truth without an honest belief in its truth.
