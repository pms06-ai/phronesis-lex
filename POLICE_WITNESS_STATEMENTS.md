# Police Witness Statements Inventory

**Date:** November 27, 2025
**Scope:** Comprehensive scan of all police witness statements (MG11) and interview records in the case file.

## 1. Formal Witness Statements (MG11)

| Witness Name | Date of Statement | File Location | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Mandy Seamark** | 22.09.2023 | `02_COURT_PROCEEDINGS_Seamark_File\0005 MG11 SEAMARK, MANDY...pdf` | Formal MG11 statement. |
| **Mandy Seamark** | Undated (Draft?) | `11_NEW_INBOX\MS stmt police 1st.docx` | Likely an initial draft or copy. |
| **Glenn Dunmore** | 23.09.2023 | `02_COURT_PROCEEDINGS_Hearings\mandy proceedings\...\0004 MG11 DUNMORE...pdf` | Paternal Grandfather. |
| **"PGM" (Paternal Grandmother)**| Undated | `02_COURT_PROCEEDINGS_Seamark_File\pgm police stmt.docx` | Multiple versions found (`PGM police.docx`, `PGM WITNESS STATEMENT.docx`). |
| **Unknown / Unnamed** | Undated | `04_EVIDENCE_General_Documents\Police\Police Statement - Death Threat .docx` | Needs review to identify author. |

## 2. Police Interview Records (Suspect/Respondent)

| Interviewee | Date | File Location | Format |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Samantha Stephen** | 30.03.2023 | `05_PARTIES_SJS\Police interviews\samantha interview mar 30 23.docx` | Word Document Transcript. |
| **Paul Stephen** | Undated | `07_INVESTIGATIONS...\MCU\...\Paul Stephen - PS Interview notes.docx` | Interview Notes. |
| **Stephen Alderton** | Undated | `07_INVESTIGATIONS...\MCU\Alderton interviews.pdf` | Interview Record. |
| **Unknown** | 07.03.XXXX | `07_INVESTIGATIONS...\MCU\...\Interview record - 07.03[1351].docx` | Interview Record. |

## 3. Key Observations
*   **Mandy Seamark** has both a formal PDF MG11 (signed) and Word doc drafts. The PDF (22.09.23) should be treated as the authoritative version.
*   **Glenn Dunmore** statement is located deep in the "Hearings" folder, not with the main police evidence.
*   **"PGM"** statements are currently in Word format only, suggesting they may be drafts or unsworn copies.
*   **Interview Transcripts** for Paul and Samantha are available in `.docx`, which allows for text searching/analysis, whereas the Alderton interview is a PDF.

## 4. Missing / To Locate
*   Are there MG11s for **Paul Stephen** or **Samantha Stephen**? (Usually, suspects give interviews, not witness statements, but they might have given statements in the *previous* proceedings or as victims in related matters).
*   **Police Officer Statements:** Aside from the "Officer.docx" in the MCU folder, there are no individual MG11s from officers (e.g., DC Denunes) listed in this scan. They are likely contained within the large `G_Police_Disclosure.pdf` bundle.
