# PHRONESIS LEX: VIOLATION-CENTERED ANALYSIS
## Lean Framework - Evidence On Demand

**Philosophy:** Start with each violation. Request only the evidence needed to prove it. Flag gaps honestly.

---

## METHODOLOGY

```
VIOLATION → WHAT WE NEED TO PROVE IT → DO WE HAVE IT? → IF NOT, REQUEST IT
```

For each alleged violation:
1. State the violation clearly
2. Identify what evidence would prove it
3. Check if we have that evidence
4. If yes: cite it precisely
5. If no: explicitly request it
6. Assess strength: STRONG / MODERATE / WEAK / UNSUBSTANTIATED

## PART 1: OFCOM BROADCASTING CODE VIOLATIONS

---

### VIOLATION 1: UNFAIR TREATMENT (Code 7.1)

**The Claim:** Channel 4 treated Paul and Samantha unjustly by portraying them as murder suspects/conspirators despite knowing they were cleared.

**What We Need to Prove This:**

| Evidence Required | Do We Have It? | Source | Strength |
|-------------------|----------------|--------|----------|
| Documentary shows suspect-framing language | ✅ YES | Part 1 transcript: "all three suspects detained" (00:26:47) | STRONG |
| Quantified imbalance (suspect vs exculpatory) | ✅ YES | Analysis: 27 suspect-framing vs 1 exculpatory (trailer only) | STRONG |
| C4 knew NFA status before broadcast | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Meeting transcripts reference NFA, but need official CPS letter date | MODERATE |
| Exculpatory evidence existed but was excluded | ⚠️ PARTIAL | We know Alderton's statement exists; need the actual document | MODERATE |

**EVIDENCE GAP - REQUEST:**
> ❓ **Needed:** The CPS NFA decision letter with date, confirming Channel 4 knew clearance status before 8 December 2025 broadcast.
> 
> ❓ **Needed:** Stephen Alderton's court statement - specifically any language about Paul/Samantha that was available to Channel 4 but not included.

**Current Assessment:** MODERATE-STRONG (upgrades to STRONG with CPS letter)

### VIOLATION 2: INACCURATE/MISLEADING PRESENTATION (Code 7.2)

|-------------------|----------------|--------|----------|
| Documentary poses conspiracy as open question | ✅ YES | Promotional framing: "did killer act alone or as part of wider conspiracy?" | STRONG |
| The question had already been answered | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Need: CPS decision, police conclusion, or judicial finding stating no conspiracy | WEAK |
| C4 knew the answer before broadcast | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Simon Ford mentions police "moving away from conspiracy" - need police document | MODERATE |

**EVIDENCE GAP - REQUEST:**
> ❓ **Needed:** Any official document (CPS, Police, Court) that definitively states there was no conspiracy or that Alderton acted alone.
>
> ❓ **Needed:** Judge's sentencing remarks - specifically any language indicating Alderton's sole responsibility (e.g., singular "you" language).

**Current Assessment:** MODERATE (upgrades to STRONG with judicial/CPS finding)

- Why critical: If "excellent stepfather" quote exists and wasn't included, proves deliberate suppression

- Why critical: Judicial finding definitively answering "conspiracy question"

### TIER 2 - IMPORTANT (Strengthens existing claims):

## NEXT STEPS

**Question for you, Paul:**

Of the TIER 1 critical documents:

1. **CPS NFA Letter** - Do you have this? If not, your solicitor should be able to obtain it as it relates to your case.

2. **Alderton's Court Statement** - Do you have this? It may have been disclosed during the investigation, or obtainable from court records.

3. **Judge's Sentencing Remarks** - Do you have this? Crown Court sentencing remarks are typically obtainable from the court or may have been reported.

**Which of these do you have access to?** That will determine which suppression claims we can fully substantiate.
