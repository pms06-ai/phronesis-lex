# Active Agents Workstream Report & Consolidation Plan

**Date:** 2025-12-01
**Generated By:** System Coordinator Agent
**Purpose:** Assist active agents (Claude, Copilot) in sorting through repository status and merging outstanding work.

## 1. Executive Summary

Analysis of the repository ecosystem reveals significant parallel development streams. A key architectural divergence has been identified in the `Phronesis` repository between Django and FastAPI implementations. The `TKSA` repository has major feature branches ready for consolidation.

## 2. Repository Analysis

### 2.1 Phronesis (Core System)
**Status:** Mixed Architecture / Divergent Paths
- **Current Workspace:** Heavily invested in `django_backend` (Analysis, Investigation, Claims).
- **Active Agent Branch (`origin/claude/claude-code-guide...`):** Implementing "production-ready FastAPI application".
- **Conflict Risk:** **HIGH**. Agents are effectively building two different backend architectures simultaneously.
- **Recommendation:** Immediate architectural decision required. If `django_backend` is the target (as per my recent work on `AnalysisRun` tasks), the FastAPI work should be evaluated for migration or deprecation.

### 2.2 TKSA (The Knowledge System Architecture)
**Status:** Active Feature Development
- **Key Branch:** `origin/claude/tksa-phase1-core-foundation...` (+13 commits)
  - Status: "Phase 4: Actor Management Foundation & Phase Completion"
  - Ready for merge: **YES** (appears to be a completed phase).
- **Key Branch:** `origin/claude/uk-child-protection-team...` (+25 commits)
  - Status: "Add post-deployment guide"
  - Focus: Deployment/Documentation.
- **Key Branch:** `origin/copilot/identify-slow-code-improvements` (+12 commits)
  - Status: "Address additional review feedback..."
  - Focus: Performance/Refactoring.

### 2.3 Other Repositories
- **agents:** `origin/copilot/clean-audit-improve` is **MERGED**. Clean.
- **operation-no-comment:** Copilot has active debug/improvement branches.

## 3. Active Workstreams (By Agent)

### Agent: Claude
*   **Phronesis:** Building FastAPI backend (divergent).
*   **TKSA:** Completed Phase 1 Core Foundation.
*   **TKSA:** Deployment documentation.

### Agent: Copilot
*   **TKSA:** Performance improvements and code review fixes.
*   **General:** Maintenance, debugging, and structure improvements across `operation-no-comment` and `Evidence_Handler`.

## 4. Recommended Actions

### Priority 1: Phronesis Architecture Convergence
The "sorting" priority is determining the backend strategy.
1.  **Review** `backend/` vs `django_backend/` in `Phronesis`.
2.  **Decide:** Is `django_backend` the definitive future? (Evidence: recent deep integration of investigation logic).
3.  **Action:** If Django is chosen, port any useful FastAPI logic (endpoints, utilities) to Django DRF views and archive the `backend/` folder.

### Priority 2: TKSA Merge Train
1.  Merge `origin/claude/tksa-phase1-core-foundation...` (Core features).
2.  Merge `origin/copilot/identify-slow-code-improvements` (Optimizations).
3.  Merge `origin/claude/uk-child-protection-team...` (Docs).

### Priority 3: Cleanup
1.  Delete merged branches in `agents` and `TKSA-Analysis`.
2.  Standardize `start-backend` scripts to point to the chosen backend (currently ambiguous).

## 5. Next Steps for Agents
*   **Backend Agent:** Halt FastAPI development until coordination decision is made. Focus on `django_backend` integrity.
*   **Frontend Agent:** Ensure API calls match the Django DRF endpoints (e.g., `/api/cases/` vs `/api/v1/...`).
*   **System Agent:** Begin merging TKSA branches.
