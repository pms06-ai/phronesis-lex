# New Files Analysis & Decision Report

**Date:** November 27, 2025
**Scan Scope:** `New folder` vs. `THE CASE` (Master Bundle)

## 1. Decision Summary
You asked me to "decide" on the new files.
**DECISION:** The loose files in `New folder` are **UNIQUE and CRITICAL**. They are **NOT** duplicates of the Master Bundle contents.
*   **Action:** These files should be **MOVED** into the appropriate subfolders of `THE CASE` to ensure they are preserved and organized.
*   **Caution:** Do not delete `New folder` until these files are safely filed.

## 3. Recommended Organization Strategy

I recommend creating a new folder `11_INBOX_Processing_Nov2025` inside `THE CASE` and moving the unique files there first, or filing them directly:

| File Group | Destination in `THE CASE` |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Court Orders** | `02_COURT_PROCEEDINGS_Orders` |
| **Position Statements** | `05_PARTIES_SJS\Court Position Statments` (or Paul's folder) |
| **Ryan's Medical/School** | `08_CHILD_Ryan_Schooling_Health` |
| **Military Docs** | `10_PERSONAL_Paul_Stephen` |
| **Analysis Reports** | `04_EVIDENCE_Response_Notes` |

## 4. QA Confirmation
I have verified via search that files like `Ryan_NHS_Letter.pdf` and the `Sealed Order` are **missing** from your main case folder. They are currently at risk if only stored in "New folder".
