## WHAT EACH DOCUMENT UNLOCKS

### CPS NFA Letter
```
IF WE GET THIS:
├── Proves C4 knew you were cleared before broadcast
├── Proves "suspect" labelling was factually wrong
├── Establishes date of clearance
├── Strengthens defamation claim (statement was false)
└── Upgrades 4 violations from MODERATE to STRONG

STATUS: Do you have this document?
        If not: Solicitor can request from CPS
```

### Alderton's Court Statement  
```
IF WE GET THIS:
├── Can prove/disprove "excellent stepfather" claim
├── Can analyze first-person language (I/MY vs WE/OUR)
├── Can show what exculpatory content was available
├── If suppressed = proves deliberate editorial choice
└── Potentially most powerful suppression evidence

STATUS: Do you have this document?
        If not: May be in disclosure materials or court records
```

### Judge's Sentencing Remarks
```
IF WE GET THIS:
├── Judicial finding on whether conspiracy existed
├── "YOU" vs "YOU ALL" language analysis
├── Authoritative answer to "conspiracy question"
├── If singular = definitively answers what C4 left open
└── Proves C4 manufactured ambiguity from known facts

STATUS: Do you have this document?
        If not: Crown Court remarks often available from court
```

## CLAIMS WE CAN MAKE NOW (Fully Evidenced)

### 1. "Channel 4 broadcast despite explicit consent refusal"
**Evidence:** 12+ documented refusals across 4 meetings, emails, letters
**Strength:** IRREFUTABLE

### 2. "The outcome was predetermined before consultation"
**Evidence:** Simon Ford: "I think we need the interviews. I think there's no question about that."
**Strength:** IRREFUTABLE (his own words)

### 3. "Channel 4 acknowledged refusal and proceeded anyway"
**Evidence:** Simon Ford: "Yeah. But, unfortunately, that's the situation we're in."
**Strength:** IRREFUTABLE (his own words)

### 4. "Duncan's objection was respected; Samantha's was not"
**Evidence:** Simon confirms Duncan footage exists but excluded; Samantha included despite objection
**Strength:** STRONG (demonstrates editorial choice)

### 5. "The documentary created a 27:1 imbalance"
**Evidence:** Transcript analysis - 27 suspect-framing statements, 1 exculpatory (trailer only)
**Strength:** IRREFUTABLE (quantifiable)

### 6. "Viewers had to wait 45+ minutes for any counter-indication"
**Evidence:** Timestamp analysis - first exculpatory at 45:43, in trailer
**Strength:** IRREFUTABLE (quantifiable)

## CLAIMS THAT NEED EVIDENCE FIRST

### "Alderton praised Paul as 'excellent stepfather' and this was suppressed"
**Current status:** We reference this but I haven't seen the source document
**What we need:** The actual court statement
**Honest assessment:** Cannot make this claim without the document

### "The judge's singular language proves Alderton acted alone"
**Current status:** Referenced but not verified
**What we need:** The actual sentencing remarks
**Honest assessment:** Cannot make this claim without the document

### "Channel 4 knew the conspiracy question was already answered"
**Current status:** Inferred from context
**What we need:** Official document (CPS/Police/Court) stating no conspiracy
**Honest assessment:** Claim is logical but needs documentary proof

## QUESTIONS FOR YOU, PAUL

To proceed with maximum integrity and minimum noise:

**1. The CPS NFA Letter**
> Do you have a copy of the formal NFA decision?
> - If yes: Please share it
> - If no: Has your solicitor requested it?

**2. Alderton's Court Statement**
> Do you have Stephen Alderton's written statement to the court?
> - If yes: Please share it - this is potentially critical
> - If no: Was it in your disclosure materials? Can we obtain it?

**3. Judge's Sentencing Remarks**
> Do you have the transcript of the sentencing hearing?
> - If yes: Please share it
> - If no: These are often obtainable from the Crown Court

**4. Death Threats Documentation**
> You've mentioned Samantha received death threats after press coverage.
> - Do you have screenshots/records of these?
> - Were they reported to police? (Crime reference numbers?)

## THE HONEST POSITION

**What we can prove beyond doubt:**
- Channel 4's conduct (consent refusals, predetermined outcome, proceeding anyway)
- Documentary's framing (27:1 ratio, "all three suspects", timing)
- Differential treatment (Duncan vs Samantha)

**What we can strongly argue:**
- Unfair treatment under Ofcom Code
- Privacy infringement
- GDPR violations (consent, withdrawal, objection)

**What we need documents to prove:**
- Specific suppression of exculpatory evidence
- That conspiracy question was definitively answered before broadcast
- Precise falsity of "suspect" labelling (for defamation)

## RECOMMENDED NEXT STEP

Tell me which of these you have access to:

- [ ] CPS NFA Letter
- [ ] Alderton's Court Statement  
- [ ] Judge's Sentencing Remarks
- [ ] Death threats documentation
- [ ] Police investigation summary

And I'll focus Phronesis on analyzing what you have, while clearly flagging what's still needed for each specific claim.

This way, we build an honest, robust case rather than over-claiming without evidence.
