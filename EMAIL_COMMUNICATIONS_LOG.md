## 4. Analysis of Communication Flow
*   **Immediate Crisis Management (Mar/Apr 2023):** Intense legal correspondence between **Tim Colbran** (Sam's Solicitor) and **Lucy Ardern** (Mandy's Solicitor). The focus was immediate contact with the children following the arrests.
*   **Role of RAF Mildenhall:** The "Hippo Room" / Family Advocacy Suite at the base was proposed as a safe, neutral venue for contact, highlighting the military context.
*   **Direct Family Conflict:** Mandy Seamark (Grandmother) applied to join proceedings almost immediately (April 3rd), pitting her against Sam/Paul regarding the children's care.
*   **Social Work Delays:** The July/August emails suggest parents were chasing the Local Authority (Fran Balmford) for basic health and school updates, indicating potential communication breakdowns.
